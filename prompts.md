1. Uses YAML-based model specification instead of hardcoded architecture
2. Allows for dynamic model architecture during hyperparameter tuning
3. Maintains compatibility with the existing training pipeline
4. Supports residual connections and different activation functions
5. Makes model architecture more configurable and maintainable
